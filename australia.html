          <p class="card-text">The multicultural city of Melbourne is one of the most important industrial, commercial, cultural and sporting centers of Australia. After Sydney, this city is the second most populous in the country and is noted for its attractive Victorian architecture. The best way to get to Melbourne is by plane Although for this we will have to make a connection in a city in Europe, for example, if we travel from Spain we will have to go to the international airport of Madrid or Barcelona and from there take a flight to this destination. The best way to get to know the center of Melbourne is by walking, by bike or by car. bus car. For longer distances it is advisable to mobilize with metro and trolley services and if we prefer to go at our own pace without looking at schedules and other details, it is better to use a taxi service or rent a car. In Melbourne we will find accommodation for all budgets, from luxury hotels, hostels, guesthouses to famous backpackers. It is recommended to settle in the city center to have access to museums, theaters, entertainment centers, etc.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Canberra Places , Idea for Tourism</h5>
          <p class="card-text">You might want to live in Australia’s capital city for several reasons. Twenty-five per cent of Canberra‘s residents were born outside of Australia. It is considered one of the safest cities in the country. Thousands of international citizens come to Canberra yearly for education or employment opportunities. It is affordable, especially compared to larger cities like Sydney and Melbourne. While Canberra doesn’t have beautiful beaches like most of the cities on this list, there are plenty of other places to enjoy, such as parks and recreation centres. You’ll find several exciting places here if you’re a history buff.
            The small-yet-mighty capital of Canberra is a city that punches far above its weight. Well-known museums and historical sites are just the beginning. Dig a little deeper to find bustling brewpubs, hidden gems, quiet nature and family-friendly attractions. Head just outside the city to relax and unwind in a scenic cool-climate wine region that produces some stellar drops.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Darwin Places , Idea for Tourism</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Darwin is the multicultural coastal hub of the Northern Territory. While a gateway to some of Northern Australia’s most stunning natural wonders, Darwin itself is a place for you to indulge in the Top End’s laid back tropical lifestyle. Darwin city has been transformed in recent years to become a vibrant centre for street art, bars and restaurants. The city has grown into an unexpected foodie paradise with a refreshing mix of local markets, funky cafes and restaurants with an eclectic range of cuisines. Stroll the leafy streets, explore the beaches and tidal flats or relax poolside and enjoy Darwin’s endless summer. 
            My favorite spot in Darwin has to be Mindil Beach, and specifically the Mindil Beach Night Markets. During the dry season, two nights a week Mindil Beach is the place to be! Tons of market stalls are set up that sell food, snacks, and souvenirs. Traditional didgeridoo music is performed, and locals sit on the beach with a glass of wine in hand while watching the sunset.It is a mix of tourists and locals that go to the Mindil Beach Night Markets, and the vibe is electric and relaxing at the same time.</p>
