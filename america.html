          <h5 class="card-title">Brasil Places , Idea for Tourism</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Tourism is a growing sector and key to the economy of several regions of Brazil. The country had 6.589 million visitors in 2018, ranking in terms of the international tourist arrivals as the second main destination in South America after Argentina and third in Latin America after Mexico and Argentina. Revenues from international tourists reached US$5.8 billion in 2015, continuing a recovery trend from the 2008–2009 economic crisis.Brazil offers for both domestic and international tourists an ample range of options, with natural areas being its most popular tourism product, a combination of leisure and recreation, mainly sun and beach, and adventure travel, as well as historic and cultural tourism. Among the most popular destinations are beaches at Rio de Janeiro and Santa Catarina, beaches and dunes in the Northeast Region, business trips to São Paulo city, cultural and historic tourism in Minas Gerais, the Iguazu Falls and the Pantanal in the Center-West Region.In terms of the 2015 Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI), which is a measurement of the factors that make it attractive to develop business in the travel and tourism industry of individual countries, Brazil ranked in the 28th place at the world's level, third in the Americas, after Canada and United States.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Argentina Places , Idea for Tourism</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Argentina, country of South America, covering most of the southern portion of the continent. The world’s eighth largest country, Argentina occupies an area more extensive than Mexico and the U.S. state of Texas combined. It encompasses immense plains, deserts, tundra, and forests, as well as tall mountains, rivers, and thousands of miles of ocean shoreline. Argentina also claims a portion of Antarctica, as well as several islands in the South Atlantic, including the British-ruled Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas).
           Argentina has long played an important role in the continent’s history. Following three centuries of Spanish colonization, Argentina declared independence in 1816, and Argentine nationalists were instrumental in revolutionary movements elsewhere, a fact that prompted 20th-century writer Jorge Luis Borges to observe, “South America’s independence was, to a great extent, an Argentine enterprise.” Torn by strife and occasional war between political factions demanding either central authority (based in Buenos Aires) or provincial autonomy, Argentina tended toward periods of caudillo, or strongman, leadership, most famously under the presidency of Juan Perón. The 1970s ushered in a period of military dictatorship and repression during which thousands of presumed dissidents were “disappeared,” or murdered; this ended in the disastrous Falklands Islands War of 1982, when Argentina invaded the South Atlantic islands it claimed as its own and was defeated by British forces in a short but bloody campaign</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">New York Places , Idea for Tourism</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Your heart beats a little faster in New York City. Whether it’s a first visit or you’ve been here a hundred times, it’s always exciting.

All five boroughs feature must-see attractions, amazing restaurants, and cultural hotspots. Find unforgettable experiences, from high tea at the Plaza Hotel to high-flying at the Trapeze School New York. 
          With stunning architecture and lush parks, New York is one of the world’s most beautiful cities. Take a double-decker bus tour, stroll the Brooklyn Bridge, or see the spectacular skyline with a free ride on the Staten Island Ferry. Catch sky-high views from a rooftop bar, the Empire State Building or One World Observatory, the Western Hemisphere’s tallest building.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Columbia Places , Idea for Tourism</h5>
          <p class="card-text"> Colombia is very big! It’s roughly twice the size of France. Trying to include everything in a single trip is impossible unless you have a lot of time. You can check out these Colombia itineraries for some ideas on specific regions or cities to tackle for a first-time trip to Colombia.Secondly, Colombia is not nearly as unsafe as it once was. While it’s far from a crime-free paradise, popular tourist destinations are quite safe these days — at least on par with many other South American destinations. Of course, you still have to be a bit more careful in Colombia than in other parts of the world.
          Thirdly, thanks to its diverse geography, you can have a great variety of experiences. It has a Pacific and Caribbean coast (both very different), the start of the Andes mountain range, the Amazon rainforest, sandy deserts, hilly coffee country, tropical plains dotted with cow ranches, and many buzzing cities.Beyond certain clichéd images around narcotrafficking, Colombia is known for many much more notable things!</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Rio de Zhaneiro Places , Idea for Tourism</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Rio de Janeiro, city and port, capital of the estado (state) of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It is located on the Atlantic Ocean, in the southeastern part of the tropical zone of South America, and is widely recognized as one of the world’s most beautiful and interesting urban centres. Although Rio de Janeiro continues to be the preeminent icon of Brazil in the eyes of many in the world, in reality its location, architecture, inhabitants, and lifestyle make it highly unique when compared with other Brazilian cities, especially the country’s capital of Brasília or the much larger city of São Paulo. The former is a much smaller city dating back only to the 1960s, while the latter is a huge, sprawling commercial and manufacturing centre with none of Rio’s spectacular natural beauty or captivating charm. Unlike Rio, both are located on flat interior plateaus.Rio de Janeiro is well known for the beauty of its beaches and of its peaks, ridges, and hills—all partly covered by tropical forests. The city is a centre of leisure for Brazilian and foreign tourists, and people wearing bathing suits can be seen walking in the streets and along the beaches or traveling on the city’s buses. Perhaps at no time is the city’s festive reputation better displayed than during the annual pre-Lenten Carnival, which enlivens the city night and day with music, singing, parties, balls, and street parades of brilliantly costumed dancers performing to samba rhythms. Rio is also an important economic centre, however, with activities ranging from industry and national and international trade to administration, banking, education, culture, and research. </p>
