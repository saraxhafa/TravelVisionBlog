          <h5 class="card-title">Thailand Places , Idea for Tourism</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Thailand, otherwise known as the land of smiles, continues its rise from camping paradise to mainstream vacation favorite. The allure is evident from the beauty of the country's surroundings, very good food, friendly people and low prices. But Thailand has an amazing cultural heritage, filled with Buddhist ideals. There's a reason why Thailand attracts over 20 million international visitors a year: the country has a lot to offer! Another way to safely explore the Thai wilderness is through the various national parks and nature reserves. They are located all over Thailand and offer an opportunity to admire different parts of the country. In total there are more than 50 nature reserves and national parks in the kingdom, which in total occupy 25 thousand square kilometers.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">China Places , Idea for Tourism</h5>
          <p class="card-text">China is a country with a large number of nationalities and each Chinese city has its own architectural characteristics. To the north is Beijing, the capital of China; to the east Shanghai, the economic center of the country; to the west is Lhasa, a city with a beautiful landscape and distinctive nationalities, and to the south is Kunming, called the "city of spring". These beautiful and prosperous cities shine like pearls in the Chinese territory, which stretches over 9.6 million square kilometers. More than 100 cities in China have won the title of "national-level excellent tourism city", including Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Hangzhou, Dalian, Nanjing, Xiamen Guangzhou, Chengdu, Shenyang, Qingdao, Ningbo, Xian, Harbin, Jinan, Changchun and Lhasa. In addition, at least 10 famous historical and cultural cities have been selected, including Harbin, Jilin, Zhengzhou, Zhaoqing, Liuzhou and Qingdao.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">India Places , Idea for Tourism</h5>
          <p class="card-text">India is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh largest country in terms of area, while the second largest in terms of population. India's coastline is 7,517 kilometers long. India is the cradle of several religions in Asia, and these are Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism, Jainism. Throughout history, many different cultures, races and religions have lived in India. India is very diverse socially, culturally and linguistically. Hindi and English are widely spoken and recognized as official languages. In addition, there are 22 languages ​​recognized by the constitution of India. However, more than 400 languages ​​and dialects in India are still unknown. Dialects change even with a few kilometers of travel in the state. Over the years, about 190 languages ​​have become endangered due to very few surviving speakers.
            Religion has historically influenced Indian society at a political, cultural and economic level. There is a sense of pride associated with the country's rich religious history as the traditions of Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Jainism all emerged from India. Furthermore, while the majority of people in India identify as Hindu, the mix of religions that exist within the country continue to influence contemporary society. This becomes evident when considering the many spaces that are thought to be sacred. Examples include 'ashrams' (monasteries or places of congregation) consisting of large communities of scholars or monks, temples (mandirs), shrines and specific landscapes such as the Ganges River. There is a rich religious history evident in the architecture and it is not unusual to find various places of worship, such as a Hindu temple, Muslim mosque and Christian church, all next to each other. </p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Dubai Places , Idea for Tourism</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Dubai has been ranked first in a recent study as the best holiday destination in the world. The coveted emirate is praised for its "glorious sunshine and luxurious lifestyle", wrote the Premier Inn chain, which carried out the research. With its extravagant restaurants, virgin coast shops and resorts, the city was the first choice for travelers from 21 countries. Saudi, Kenya, Nigeria, India and the Maldives. Using Google user statistics, Premier Inn analyzed holidaymakers' searches for potential destinations in 136 different countries. So the study is not a concrete verification of tourists in the country, but an indirect signal for the trend of vacationers. Dubai is built in the desert and gets its drinking water from the desalination of sea water, a situation that is ironic compared to Western Europe which is currently in a period of water, energy and financial crisis.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Maldives Places , Idea for Tourism</h5>
          <p class="card-text">As if painted by an artist's brush, the Maldives is a symphony of sun, sand and sea. Suspended in the warm clutches of the Indian Ocean, this island paradise shines like a precious gem. Unrivaled in its beauty, the Maldives has become a thriving destination coveted by avid tourists from around the globe. Sprinkled across the ocean, the best places to visit in the Maldives shine like glittering pearls, each unique and alluring. As Mark Twain aptly said, "Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness." The Maldives is a testament to this belief. The turquoise ocean hums its soothing melody as you lounge on the sun-kissed beaches. As the salty air caresses your cheeks, the echo of the local Boduberu drum fills the atmosphere. A walk around the island becomes a journey of a thousand stories, mixing the old with the new, the eternal and the changing. Every island and atoll whispers tales of nature's bounty and human ingenuity. So pack your bags, roll up your sleeves and get ready to write your Maldives chronicles!</p>
